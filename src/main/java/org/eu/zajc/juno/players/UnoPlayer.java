 * A class representing a player in UNO. A UNO player owns {@link UnoHand}s and
 * contains the logic that determines what card is to be placed when it gets a turn
 * ({@link #playCard(UnoGame)}) whether or not it should place a newly-drawn card
 * ({@link #shouldPlayDrawnCard(UnoGame, UnoCard)}) and what color to
 * assign to wild cards ({@link #chooseColor(UnoGame)}). A {@link UnoPlayer} can
 * either be autonomous (an example of that would be {@link UnoStrategicPlayer}) or
 * controlled by a human being (for example {@link UnoStreamPlayer} and
 * {@link UnoConsolePlayer}).
