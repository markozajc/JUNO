/**
 * A house {@link UnoRulePack} that implements the official SevenO house rule. The
 * rule adds the mechanic of swapping hands whenever a {@link UnoNumericCard} with
 * the number seven (7) or zero (0) is placed. As JUNO only supports two-player
 * games, both of the numbers act the same (instead of seven allowing you to choose
 * the player to swap hands with and zero forcing you to swap cards with the player
 * next to you). This {@link UnoRulePack} is also referenced by
 * {@link UnoHouseRule#SEVENO}, which is makes it easy to install into
 * {@link UnoOfficialRules}.
 *
 * @deprecated <b>UnoSevenORulePack currently contains several inaccuracies. This may
 *             be fixed in a further release, or it may be removed. Proceed with
 *             caution:</b><br>
 *             <ul>
 *             <li>If a player's last placed card is a zero or a seven, the swapped
 *             player wins. This is inaccurate.
 *             <li>This rule currently only supports games with two players. This is
 *             because having the player make a decision during the rule phases is
 *             currently unsupported (beyond choosing a colour for the wild card,
 *             which is already implemented in a hacky way), but would be required
 *             for the "Seven" part of the Seven-O rule.
 *             </ul>
