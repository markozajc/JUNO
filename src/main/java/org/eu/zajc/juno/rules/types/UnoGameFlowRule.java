 * A rule type that controls the flow of the game in {@link UnoControlledGame}. Flow
 * control comes in two parts (phases):
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>initialization</b> is the phase called at the beginning of a turn. Rules
 * should activate and close their respective {@link UnoCard} in this phase. This
 * phase returns {@link UnoInitializationConclusion}, which allows repeating the
 * phase and skipping the next (decision) phase - also skipping the player's turn.
 * <li><b>decision</b> is the phase called right after the {@link UnoPlayer} decides
 * a card to place. The rules that implement this phase should be careful not to
 * conflict with each other. The goal of this phase is getting the decided
 * {@link UnoCard} onto the discard pile and opening the cards that will be activated
 * in the next turn by the initialization phase. This phase returns a
 * {@link UnoPhaseConclusion}, which allows repeating the phase.
 * </ul>
